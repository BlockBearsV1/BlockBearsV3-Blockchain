Certainly! Here's an updated version of the code with the blockchain name included:

1. Install Termux from the Google Play Store or F-Droid.

2. Open Termux and install the required dependencies by running the following command:
   ```
   pkg install golang git
   ```

3. Set up the Go environment by running the following commands:
   ```
   export GOPATH=$HOME/go
   export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
   ```

4. Install Geth by running the following command:
   ```
   go get -u github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum
   ```

5. Create a new directory for your blockchain project and navigate to it:
   ```
   mkdir myblockchain
   cd myblockchain
   ```

6. Create a new file called `genesis.json` and add the following content:
   ```json
   {
     "config": {
       "chainId": 1234,
       "homesteadBlock": 0,
       "eip150Block": 0,
       "eip155Block": 0,
       "eip158Block": 0,
       "name": "BlocksBearsV3"
     },
     "alloc": {},
     "coinbase": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
     "difficulty": "0x20000",
     "extraData": "",
     "gasLimit": "0x2fefd8",
     "nonce": "0x0000000000000042",
     "mixhash": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
     "parentHash": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
     "timestamp": "0x00"
   }
   ```

7. Initialize the blockchain by running the following command:
   ```
   geth --datadir ./data init genesis.json
   ```

8. Start the blockchain node by running the following command:
   ```
   geth --datadir ./data --rpc --rpcaddr "localhost" --rpcport "8545" --rpccorsdomain "*" --rpcapi "eth,net,web3,personal,miner" --allow-insecure-unlock console
   ```

9. You are now in the Geth console. You can interact with the blockchain using JavaScript commands. 

10. 
  
   For Building the frontend using Angular in Termux can be a bit challenging since Termux is primarily designed for command-line operations and doesn't have a graphical user interface. However, you can still write the Angular code in Termux and then transfer it to a machine with a graphical interface for building and running the frontend.

Here's how you can set up the frontend using Angular in Termux:

1. Install Node.js and npm:
   - Open Termux and run the following command to install Node.js and npm:
     ```
     pkg install nodejs
     ```

2. Install Angular CLI:
   - Run the following command to install the Angular CLI globally:
     ```
     npm install -g @angular/cli
     ```

3. Create a new Angular project:
   - Navigate to the desired directory where you want to create the project:
     ```
     cd /path/to/project-directory
     ```
   - Run the following command to create a new Angular project:
     ```
     ng new frontend-app
     ```

4. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd frontend-app
   ```

5. Start the development server:
   - Run the following command to start the Angular development server:
     ```
     ng serve
     ```

6. Open a web browser on your machine with a graphical interface and access the development server's URL (usually http://localhost:4200) to see the Angular app running.

From here, you can start building the frontend of your web app using Angular. You can create components, services, and other necessary files using the Angular CLI commands. Remember to transfer the code to a machine with a graphical interface for building and running the frontend, as Termux itself doesn't provide a graphical interface for running Angular applications.
